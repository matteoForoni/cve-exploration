# Dataset Exploration

To launch the project: ```streamlit run .\cve_exploration.py```
Other files:
- ```python_raw.py```: file to test python commands
- ```server_generator.py```: file to generate a new list of servers
- ```column_descriptor.py```: file to export columns help for each datasets

## CVE datasets
Columns:
- ```cve_id```: CVE ID
- ```mod_date```: last modified date
- ```pub_date```: publication date
- ```cvss```: Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) score, a measure of the severity of a vulnerability
- ```cwe_code```: Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) code, identifying the type of weakness
- ```cwe_name```: The name associated with the CWE code
- ```summary```: A text summary of the vulnerability
- ```access_authentication```: users' authentication necessary to exploit the vulnerability (SINGLE referers to 1 users)
- ```access_complexity```: complexity for logging into systems to exploit the vulnerability
- ```access_vector```: where do logins come from
- ```impact_availability```: the exploit of the vulnerability can affect the availability of the system
- ```impact_confidentiality```: the exploit of the vulnerability can affect the confidentiality of the system
- ```impact_integrity```: the exploit of the vulnerability can affect the integrity of the system

## Products datasets
Columns:
- ```cve_id```: CVE ID
- ```vulnerable_product```: identifier of the vulnerable product

## Vendors datasets
Columns:
- ```cve_id```: CVE ID
- ```vendor```: identifier of the vendor which is the developer of the product affected by the cve specified

## Vendor_product datasets
Columns:
- ```id```: progessive identifier
- ```vendor```: identifier of the vendor 
- ```product```: identifier of the product 

## Useful information
- CVE and Vendor datasets can be combined using cve_id columns
- CVE and Products datasets can be combined using cve_id columns
